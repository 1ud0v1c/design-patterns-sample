# Design pattern 

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

## The 23 Gang of Four Design Patterns 

These 23 GoF patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: 

- **Creational**: creational patterns are ones that create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly, this gives your program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
- **Structural**: these concern class and object composition
- **Behavioral**: these design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

## Creational Patterns

- [Builder pattern](builder/README.md)
- [Singleton pattern](singleton/README.md)

## Structural Patterns

- [Adapter pattern](adapter/README.md)

## Behavioral Patterns

- [Command pattern](command/README.md)
- [Iterator pattern](iterator/README.md)
