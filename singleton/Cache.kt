/**
 * In Kotlin, the singleton pattern is used as a replacement for static members and fields that donâ€™t exist in that programming language. A singleton is created by 
 * simply declaring an object. As follow:
 *
 * object CacheManager {
 *     init {
 *         println("init complete")
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * The object will be instantiated and its init blocks will be executed lazily upon first access, in a thread-safe way. To achieve this, a Kotlin object actually relies on a Java static initialization 
 * block. The above Kotlin object will be compiled to the following equivalent Java code:
 * 
 * public final class CacheManager {
 *     public static final CacheManager INSTANCE;
 *
 *     private CacheManager() {
 *         INSTANCE = (CacheManager) this;
 *		   System.out.println("init complete");
 *	   }
 *	   
 *	   static {
 *	       new CacheManager();
 * 	   }
 * }
 */
object CacheManager {
    private val cache: MutableMap<String, String> = mutableMapOf()

    fun put(key: String, value: String) {
        when {
            !key.isEmpty() -> cache.put(key, value)
            else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Key cannot be empty")
        }
    }

    fun get(key: String): String? {
        when {
            cache.containsKey(key) -> return cache.get(key)
            else -> return null
        }
    }
}
