# Singleton pattern

The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. It involves a single class which is responsible to create an object 
while making sure that only one single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object, which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.
